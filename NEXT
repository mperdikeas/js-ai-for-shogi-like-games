[1] I am left to work in file [move-tree-builder.js]
method [moveTreeBuilder] to put a floor to the recursion
also in the case where a move would place our King in check
(and to not create a node / link at all in such a case).

To verify I have to confirm that the trees created are actually
sparser. Also I have to deal with the edge case that there
are no possible moves (if we take that into account) and so
maybe throw an exception to prompt the AI to resign.

[2] when the AI discovers a win path at more than one (1) move
away it should taunt the user with a disparaging message.
